    "The harmonic oscillator with force constant $k_{f}$ has potential energy $ V = k_{f}x^2 / 2 $ at displacement $x$ from its minimum energy. To make the calculation classical, many energy levels must be populated at temperature T. This implies that a very high temperature or a very small force constant should be used such that $k_{f}/T$ is small, for example 0.05. A temperature of 300K and $k_{f} = 10 Nm^-1$ is used. This force constant is far smaller than that for many molecules although alkali metal dimers do have small force constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the average energy, random guess of the values of the displacement are made. To allow complete sampling of the distribution, the maximum displacement must be large enough to make $e^-(V/kT)$ small, $10^-8$ or less. In addition, the range of $x$ must be positive as well as negative, and the random number generator must ensure this. If this is not done, then microscopic reversibility is not achieved because not all the possible configurations, in this case bond extension, can be sampled. "

These will vary slightly each time the calculation is run, but when the number of trials is large, about 20000, they are always close to the theoretical values (per molecule) which are $\\langle E \\rangle = 2.07 \\times 10^-21 J$ , $\\langle E^2 \\rangle = 1.28 \\times 10^-41 J^2$, and $ C_{v} = 6.90 \\times 10^-24 JK^-1$ at 300K.\n",
