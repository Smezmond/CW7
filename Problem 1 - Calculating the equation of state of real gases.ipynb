    "__Monte Carlo Methods for Integration__\n",

    "The direct Monte Carlo method is the simplest of all Monte Carlo methods to numerically integrate a function. The area corresponding to the integral is calculated by repeatedly guessing pairs of x and y values at random and evaluating a function y = f(x) to see if y lies within the area bound by the integral or not. The ration of guesses inside/under the curves to the total number of guesses is proportional to the integral. The more guesses that are made, the closer the answer becomes to the true value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general the integral is $Q = \\int_a^b \\! f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. Two uniform distributed random numbers are chosen; $R_{y}$ between limits f(c) and f(d), where the points c and d must be chosen to include the minimum and maximum of the function in the range a and b. A large number of pairs of points are generated, those for which $R_{y} \\leq f(R_{x})$ are found and counted up. The integral is approximated as:\n",
